    ##    the memory that can be given instantly to processes without the
    ##    system going into swap.
    ##    This is calculated by summing different memory values depending
    ##    on the platform and it is supposed to be used to monitor actual
    ##    memory usage in a cross platform fashion.
    ##  - percent:
    ##    the percentage usage calculated as (total - available) / total * 100
    ##  - used:
    ##    memory used, calculated differently depending on the platform and

    ##    (use 'available' instead)
    ## Platform-specific fields:
    ##  - active (UNIX):
    ##    memory currently in use or very recently used, and so it is in RAM.
    ##  - inactive (UNIX):
    ##    memory that is marked as not used.
    ##  - buffers (BSD, Linux):
    ##    cache for things like file system metadata.
    ##  - cached (BSD, OSX):
    ##    cache for various things.
    ##  - wired (OSX, BSD):
    ##    memory that is marked to always stay in RAM. It is never moved to disk.
    ##  - shared (BSD):
    ##    memory that may be simultaneously accessed by multiple processes.
    ## The sum of 'used' and 'available' does not necessarily equal total.
